    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Raceplace (&ldquo;the App&rdquo;) is operated by <strong>[COMPANY_NAME]</strong> (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;).
      Raceplace is part of the Boathouse digital canoe &amp; kayak racing platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The App allows paddlers to compete in virtual races, track training progress, and appear on leaderboards by connecting
      their Garmin Connect account so we can read their paddle activity data.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, why we collect it, how we use and protect it, and the
      choices you have. It applies to all users of the App and this website.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:[DATA_PROTECTION_EMAIL]">[DATA_PROTECTION_EMAIL]</a>.

    <!-- 8. Garmin Connection, Disconnect & Deletion -->
    <h2 id="garmin-connection">8. Garmin Connection, Disconnect &amp; Deletion</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Connecting Garmin</h3>
    <p>
      When you choose to connect your Garmin account, you are redirected to Garmin&rsquo;s authorisation flow. You grant
      Raceplace permission to read the activity data categories described in section&nbsp;2.2. We do not receive or store
      your Garmin password.
    </p>

    <h3>8.2 Disconnecting Garmin</h3>
    <p>You can disconnect your Garmin account at any time using any of these methods:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>In the App:</strong> go to your account or settings area and select the option to disconnect Garmin.</li>
      <li><strong>Via Garmin:</strong> manage your connected apps through your Garmin Connect account settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact us:</strong> email <a href="mailto:[SUPPORT_EMAIL]">[SUPPORT_EMAIL]</a> and we will disconnect your account on your behalf.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Once disconnected, we will no longer import new activity data from Garmin. Activity data already imported may remain
      in our systems until you request its deletion or it is removed in accordance with our retention practices (see section&nbsp;5).
    </p>

    <h3>8.3 Requesting Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>To request deletion of your personal data:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Email <a href="mailto:[SUPPORT_EMAIL]">[SUPPORT_EMAIL]</a> with the subject line <strong>&ldquo;Delete my data&rdquo;</strong>.</li>

      <li>We will confirm receipt and process your request within <strong>[X working days]</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Upon deletion, we will remove or anonymise your identifiable data. We may retain limited information where we have
      a legal obligation or legitimate need (for example, records of transactions, fraud-prevention data, or aggregated
      anonymised statistics).
    </p>
